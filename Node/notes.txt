- It is a runtime used for creating non blocking I/O process executions
- Handles Garbage collection and Memory Management
- Non blocking synchronous operations allow single event loop to execute 
operations asynchronously by using promises, callbacks, async/await
- How does event loop works
- I/O operations are executed asynchronously using event loop 
and worker threads
- What is a port -> It is used to uniquely identify a service, in case
of multiple servers it helps the client to know which server to connect 
based on the service
- in order to return the html file we can use fs (file system) module

******************** NODE MODULES ********************
Modules are the usable code which increase the speed of development

types
* core Modules
* user built Modules
* npm Modules

some of usefull core Modules
* fs -> used to interact with the server filesystem
    -> difference between sync and non sync functions
* Readline -> used to interact with the console
* noemailer -> a transporter need to be created having info about the
                email service used and auth details then mailOptions
                (this holds the email config details) are 
                specified which can be used to sendEmail using the 
                transporter object having config info 
                a callback is passed along with mail options to catch
                any error

            -> HTML emails can be sent
            -> templates can be created and used
            -> attachments can be sent

path.join method is used to make path functions non-OS specific
